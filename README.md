Current control for dc motor.
This control receives the reference parameters by serial means, in addition to the type of signal (square, rapa and sinusoidal) and controller to be implemented, among these are continuous - discrete, discrete - discrete, LGR, dead oscillations, plant cancellation and servo system, using an ina226 as a sensor device, feeding back its value to the controller.
